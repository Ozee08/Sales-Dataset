## 📌 Project Overview  
This project demonstrates a **complete data analytics pipeline** that combines:  

1. **Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn):**  
   - Cleaning raw sales data  
   - Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
   - Identifying trends, correlations, and outliers  

2. **Power BI:**  
   - Building relationships and DAX measures  
   - Creating interactive dashboards  
   - Enabling drillthrough functionality for product-level insights  

The solution consists of:  
- **Main Dashboard (Sales Transactions Performance):** High-level KPIs, product revenue, weekly and monthly sales trends.  
- **Drillthrough Dashboard (Home Appliances):** Focused deep dive into the performance of the Home Appliances category.

## 🐍 Python – Data Cleaning & EDA  

### 🔹 Data Cleaning  
Steps taken before importing into Power BI:  
- Removed duplicates  
- Handled missing values (imputation using mean for unit prices)  
- Standardized column names  
- Exported a clean dataset for modeling  

```python
import pandas as pd  

# Load dataset  
df = pd.read_csv("sales.csv")  

# Drop duplicates  
df.drop_duplicates(inplace=True)  

# Handle missing values  
df.fillna({"UnitPrice": df["UnitPrice"].mean()}, inplace=True)  

# Standardize column names  
df.columns = df.columns.str.strip().str.lower().str.replace(" ", "_")  
df.head()  
```

## 🔹 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### EDA was conducted to uncover early patterns before visualization in Power BI.

```
# Cell 14 - plots (matplotlib)
plt.rcParams.update({'figure.max_open_warning': 0})

#  Bar: revenue by category
plt.figure(figsize=(10,5))
cats = category_summary['Product_Category']
vals = category_summary['total_revenue']
plt.bar(cats, vals)
plt.xticks(rotation=30, ha='right')
plt.title('Total Revenue by Product Category')
plt.ylabel('Total Revenue ($)')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.savefig('revenue_by_category.png')
plt.show()
```

```
#  Histogram: unit price distribution
plt.figure(figsize=(7,4))
plt.hist(df['Unit_Price'].dropna(), bins=30)
plt.title('Unit Price Distribution')
plt.xlabel('Unit Price ($)')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.savefig('unit_price_hist.png')
plt.show()
```

# 🔹 Drillthrough Dashboard – Home Appliances

## Key Metrics:

- Total Customers: 168

- Total Sales: $35K

- Net Quantity: 669

- Average Unit Price: $99

##Business Insights:

- Weekly Trend: Fridays and Mondays generate >$4K each.

- Revenue Concentration: 77% reliance on one group → risk of over-dependence.

- Seasonality: Sales rose in February → growth potential despite overall slowdown.

- Customer Drillthrough: Identifies high-value clients for targeted campaigns.
